# Mindcloud Challenge

## Run `npm install` to install dependencies

## Run `npm start` to start the project

### Requirements
- create steps component that is data-driven and can be extended;
- make sure selected step is visible;

### Assumptions
- initial state has no steps selected;
- separator should stop before last step;
- guideline should not overlap steps and stop before last step;


## Update `steps` array in `App.js` to see how the list behaves
